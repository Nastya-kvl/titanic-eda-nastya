# Titanic EDA – Nastya

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python and pandas.  
Focused on identifying survival patterns through feature exploration and visualization.

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes key features of passengers (gender, class, age, etc.) to explore correlations with survival rates. It demonstrates essential data analysis tools and techniques.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Handling missing values (e.g. Age, Cabin)
- Visual analysis of survival by class, sex, and age
- Feature distributions and correlations
- Clean visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib

## 📂 File

- `Titanic_EDA_Nastya.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and plots.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Feature engineering for ML
- Model building (e.g. logistic regression)
- Integration with scikit-learn
